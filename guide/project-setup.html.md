# Setting up Node.js

Mahabhuta is written for the Node.js platform.  That means it executes JavaScript programs, letting you leverage your jQuery and JavaScript knowledge on server-side software.  Therefore the first step is to set up Node.js on your laptop and/or server.

I won't go into this in very much depth because there is excellent documentation elsewhere.

# Initializing a Mahabhuta project

Your use of Mahabhuta is probably going to be part of a larger project.  For example, while Mahabhuta is a major feature in AkashaCMS it is not the entirety of that project.

Every Node.js project starts with running this command:

```
$ npm init
```

This initializes a `package.json` file with a few basic settings.  The `package.json` describes the project, its dependencies, and can even describe the processes you can do with the project.

You declare the Mahabhuta dependency as so:

```
$ npm install "akashacms/mahabhuta#akasharender" --save
```

At the moment the Mahabhuta version documented in this book is available solely as the `akasharender` branch in the workspace.  In the due course of time this version of Mahabhuta will be available in the npm repository.

# A small Mahabhuta example

In an empty directory, create a file named `hello-world.js` containing the following:

```
'use strict';

const mahabhuta = require('mahabhuta');

var mahafuncs = new mahabhuta.MahafuncArray("example", {});

class HelloWorld extends mahabhuta.CustomElement {
	get elementName() { return "hello-world"; }
	process($element, metadata, dirty) {
		return Promise.resolve("Hello, world!");
	}
}
mahafuncs.addMahafunc(new HelloWorld());

mahabhuta.config({
    recognizeSelfClosing: true,
    recognizeCDATA: true
});

mahabhuta.process(`
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Hi</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <hello-world></hello-world>
    </body>
    </html>
`, {}, mahafuncs, (err, html) => {
    if (err) console.error(err);
    else console.log(html);
});
```

In that directory run:

```
$ npm init
    answer all the questions
$ npm install akashacms/mahabhuta#akasharender --save
$ node ..hello-world
<html>
<head>
<title>Hi</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello, world!
</body>
</html>
```

Notice that the tag, `<hello-world>`, was replaced by the text: `Hello, world!`

```
var mahafuncs = new mahabhuta.MahafuncArray("example", {});

class HelloWorld extends mahabhuta.CustomElement {
	get elementName() { return "hello-world"; }
	process($element, metadata, dirty) {
		return Promise.resolve("Hello, world!");
	}
}
mahafuncs.addMahafunc(new HelloWorld());
```

The `MahafuncArray` object is used to store an array of what we call, for lack of a better name, Mahafunc's.  A Mahafunc is the unit of processing in Mahabhuta.  There is a base class, Mahafunc, and two subclasses one of which we see here, CustomElement.  

CustomElement instances match elements named by the `elementName` method.  For each matching element the `process` function is called, and the result of the Promise it returns are inserted into the output.

What we've done is define a MahafuncArray containing one Mahafunc.

```
mahabhuta.config({
    recognizeSelfClosing: true,
    recognizeCDATA: true
});
```

This does some necessary configuration of Mahabhuta.  Under the covers it uses Cheerio, and the configuration parameters are actually Cheerio's.

```
mahabhuta.process(`
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Hi</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <hello-world></hello-world>
    </body>
    </html>
`, {}, mahafuncs, (err, html) => {
    if (err) console.error(err);
    else console.log(html);
});
```

Here we process some HTML, using the MahafuncArray we just defined.  The second parameter is a metadata object, whose contents can be used to pass data into the Mahafunc's.  The callback either gives an error, or some HTML.

This should give a taste of what you can do with Mahabhuta.  In the next chapter we'll go more deeply into what it can do.
